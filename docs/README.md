## Game Main Core

The structure was made with modules that manages different elements of the game. Each one has, appart from their own, common methods for
awake, preupdate, update, postupdate and cleanup. App is a module that manages all the others and it calls all that methods making
each module work when it must.

All regarding to game metadata (paths of assets, character and enemies characteristics...) are loaded with XML files to avoid hardcoding,
avoid confusing code and build an easier work flow.

## Gameplay & Instructions

You must pass through each level and get to the door that will take you out!

Move left and right with A and D keys and jump with W. You can also shoot with SPACEBAR.

Each 2 flyer enemies killed or each walker enemy killed, you have one more coin! Also you can get 5 score points from flyers and 10 from walkers. Can you beat your own record?

Test yourself to pass the level in the minimum time possible with the highest score!

To pass each level, there are some platforms that are unactive. To activate them and be able to pass over them, you must press a button!
Those platforms can be also obstacles that must be deactivate by passing through the ray in order to pass the level.

ESC key inside the game pauses it and opens an in-game menu (also you can use the button in the corner).

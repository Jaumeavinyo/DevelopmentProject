## Game Main Core

The structure was made with modules that manages different elements of the game. Each one has, appart from their own, common methods for
awake, preupdate, update, postupdte and cleanup. App is a module that manages all the others and it calls all that methods making
each module work when it must.

All regarding to game metadata (paths of assets, character and enemies characteristics...) are loaded with XML files to avoid hardcoding,
avoid confusing code and build an easier work flow.
